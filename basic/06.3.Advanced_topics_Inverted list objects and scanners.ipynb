    "# Recap about IndexIVF\n",
    "The IndexIVF class (and its children) is used for all large-scale applications of Faiss. It clusters all input vectors into nlist groups (nlist is a field of IndexIVF). At add time, a vector is assigned to a groups. At search time, the most similar groups to the query vector are identified and scanned exhaustively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the IndexIVF has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the quantizer (aka coarse quantizer) index. Given a vector, the search function of the quantizer index returns the group the vector belongs to. When searched with nprobe>1 results, it returns the nprobe nearest groups to the query vector (nprobe is a field of IndexIVF).\n",
    "\n",
    "- the InvertedLists object. This object maps a group id (in 0..nlist-1), to a sequence of (code, id) pairs."

    "Codes are arbitrary byte strings of a constant size code_size. For example, an IndexIVFFlat in 36D has code_size = 36 * sizeof(float) = 144 bytes. Ids are arbitrary 64-bit integers (but negative values are reserved, so that's 63 useful bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality the codes and ids are returned in two separate arrays because some applications may need only one of them, and the memory alignement requirements are not the same.\n",

    "There is an additional prefetch_lists method, that is used by the search method to inform the InvertedLists object that some inverted lists will be required in the near future.\n",

Since the data is memory-mapped, there is no need to explicitly fetch the data from disk. However, the prefetch function is useful to exploit parallel reads on distributed file systems.\n",
    "\n",
