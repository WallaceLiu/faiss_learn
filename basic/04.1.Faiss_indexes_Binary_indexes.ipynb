    "Faiss 支持用`IndexBinaryFlat`和`IndexBinaryIVF`（它们都继承`IndexBinary`）索引 binary vectors (with `Hamming distance`) natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those indexes store the vectors as arrays of bytes, so that a vector of size d takes only d / 8 bytes in memory. Note that at the moment, only vectors with sizes multiple of 8 are supported. Of course, you can round up the vector length if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the add() and search() methods are also byte arrays (\"uint8_t\" in C++, \"uint8\" in numpy).\n",
    "\n",
