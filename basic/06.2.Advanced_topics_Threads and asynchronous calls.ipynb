    "\n",
    "Fais GPU indices are not thread-safe, even for read only functions. This is because StandardGpuResources for GPU Faiss is not thread-safe, as it manages a region of temporary memory on the GPU which can only have a single user at a time. A single StandardGpuResources object must be created for each CPU thread that is actively running a GPU Faiss index. Multiple GPU indices managed by a single CPU thread and share the same StandardGpuResources (and indeed should, as they can use the same temporary regions of GPU memory). A single GpuResources object can support multiple devices, but only from a single calling CPU thread. Multi-GPU Faiss (obtained via index_cpu_to_gpu_multiple) does internally run different GPU indices from different threads."

    "Faiss itself is internally threaded in a couple of different ways. For CPU Faiss, the three basic operations on indexes (training, adding, searching) are internally multithreaded. Threading is done through OpenMP, and a multithreaded BLAS implementation. Faiss does not set the number of threads. The caller can adjust this number via environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS or at any time by calling omp_set_num_threads(10). This function is available in Python through faiss.\n",

Therefore, several runs of the same operation with the same number of threads give the same result bitwise. The known exceptions are:\n",
